## Introduction

- Playground to demonstrate many awesome devops tools, enforce gitops pattern, build scalable and sustainable application cluster
- Got idea and well-structed ansible code from [khuedoan's homelab](https://github.com/khuedoan/homelab.git), he is a talented and enthusiastic SRE, totally worth taking a look at his awesome project

## About the project

- `M`ultiplatform support, avoid vendor lock-in that any enterprise should not be immersed in.
- `E`fficency and effortless bootstrap kubernete framework.
- `S`implicity is prerequisite for reliability.
- `S`calability design in mind.
- `A`utomation help people reduce human error, improve productivity.
- `R`eliability targeted, improve end user experience and development velocity.
- `O`ptimal solution.
- `U`tility configuration could be reused and easy to customize.
- `N`ative Kubernete applications, well-tested and production ready.
- `D`urability is a part of what makes a great system.
